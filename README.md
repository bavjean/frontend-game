# Simon Memory Game

The program is trying to mimic the electronic Simon toy. It will choose a random sequence of lights and the user must repeat them correctly. After each round there will be one additional flash added to the sequence, and the user will see how long they can reproduce the correct order.

## Getting Started

[Load the page](https://bavjean.github.io/frontend-game/) and click the Start button to begin. Recreate the sequence of lights chosen by the computer by clicking on each one in order.
